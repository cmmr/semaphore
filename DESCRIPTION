Description: Implements named semaphores from the 'boost' 'C++' library
    <https://www.boost.org/> for interprocess communication. Multiple 'R' 
    sessions on the same host can block (with optional timeout) on a semaphore
    until it becomes positive, then atomically decrement it and unblock. Any
    session can increment the semaphore.
